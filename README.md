# Quantum & Classical CFD for Navier-Stokes Flows

**author:** faisal shaik (@mrdandelion6)

this repository is a culmination of my research as i investigate and implement various classical and quantum algorithms for simulating the flow of a fluid through time and space as governed by the navier-stokes equations.

## my paper

a detailed summary of all my findings can be found in [`paper/paper.pdf`](paper/paper.pdf). this includes a rough introduction to navier-stokes for those who would like a ground-up introduction to my work.

## simulation code

you can find all code written by me in [`code/`](code/). you can find fully classical algorithms in [`code/classical/`](code/classical/) and hybrid [`classical-quantum/`](classical-quantum/) algorithms in [`code/quantum/`](code/quantum/). you will find detailed instructions in the readme files on running the code for yourself.

## references

i have read various textbooks and research papers , all of which can be found in [`REFERENCES.md`](REFERENCES.md). you can also see [`paper/references.bib`](paper/references.bib) for the bibtex citations for any papers whose results i mentioned or used in any way in my work. papers i've especially read can also be found as pdfs in [`references/`](references/).

## acknowledgments

i began this research under the supervision of professor [Dennis Fernandes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-d-fernandes-phd-078342157/?originalSubdomain=ca) for the thesis course [PHY473](https://utm.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/phy473h5) at the university of toronto. it was thanks to his trust and enthusiasm towards my project proposal that i started my investigation into these topics. the version of my paper that i submitted as partial credit for PHY473 can be found in [`papers/PHY473/report.pdf`](papers/PHY473/report.pdf).
